  ðŸŽ¯ KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTED:

  1. Performance Separation

  - Bronze: Heavy write database, optimized for ingestion
  - Silver/Gold: Responsive database, optimized for analytics queries

  2. Data Quality Pipeline

  - Bronze â†’ Silver: Data cleansing, type conversion, validation
  - Silver â†’ Gold: Denormalization, aggregation, pre-calculation

  3. Audit & Lineage

  - Bronze: Source tracking (br_source_file, br_batch_id)
  - Silver: Data quality scores (sl_data_quality_score)
  - Gold: Calculation versioning (gl_calculation_version)

  4. Analytics Optimization

  - Denormalized dimensions for query performance
  - Pre-calculated metrics to avoid complex joins
  - Time-based partitioning keys for efficient filtering
  - Star schema design with fact/dimension separation

  5. Business Intelligence Ready

  - Customer segmentation (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum tiers)
  - Behavioral analysis (preferred times, genres, patterns)
  - Predictive scores (churn risk, upsell opportunity)
  - Operational metrics (overdue rates, inventory turnover)

  ðŸš€ READY FOR ELT PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT

  The medallion architecture is now complete with:
  - âœ… Bronze tables ready for raw data ingestion
  - âœ… Silver tables ready for data transformation/validation
  - âœ… Gold tables ready for analytics and reporting
  - âœ… Database builders configured for both environments
  - âœ… Schema processing orders set correctly
  - âœ… Full relationship modeling with proper foreign keys

  Next Steps: Create PySpark ELT jobs in the transforms/ folders to populate each layer! ðŸŽŠ
