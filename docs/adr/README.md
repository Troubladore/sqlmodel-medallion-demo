## Status Definitions

- **‚úÖ Accepted**: Decision is approved and implemented
- **üîÑ Proposed**: Decision is under review
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
- **‚ùå Rejected**: Decision was considered but not adopted

## ADR Process

### When to Create an ADR
- Any architectural decision that affects multiple layers/components
- Technology choices that impact platform direction
- Design patterns that will be reused across the platform
- Breaking changes that affect external interfaces
- Performance or scalability decisions with long-term impact

### ADR Template
Use the template in `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` for consistency.

### Review Process
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Review**: Team review and discussion
3. **Decision**: Mark as "Accepted", "Rejected", or "Deprecated"
4. **Implementation**: Execute the decision
5. **Update**: Maintain ADR as implementation evolves

## Platform Impact Classification

- **Critical**: Affects core platform architecture or data integrity
- **High**: Significant impact on performance, scalability, or user experience
- **Medium**: Important design decisions with moderate platform impact
- **Low**: Local decisions with minimal platform-wide effects

*ADRs capture the "why" behind our architectural decisions, ensuring institutional knowledge persists as the platform evolves.*
