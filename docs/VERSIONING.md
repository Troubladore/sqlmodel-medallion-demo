# 🏷️ Platform Versioning Strategy

> **Purpose**: Define consistent versioning, release management, and evolution tracking for the SQLModel Medallion Demo platform.

---

## 🎯 Semantic Versioning Strategy

The platform follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with data platform-specific interpretations:

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
│     │     └─ Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates
│     └─ New features, schema additions, non-breaking enhancements  
└─ Breaking changes, architecture overhauls, major data model changes
```

### Version Increment Criteria

#### MAJOR Version (x.0.0) - Breaking Changes
**Trigger Events:**
- Breaking schema changes requiring data migration
- Incompatible API changes affecting consumers  
- Major architecture overhauls (e.g., medallion → data mesh)
- Technology stack changes (e.g., Spark 3.x → 4.x migration)
- Data model changes requiring consumer updates

**Examples:**
- `0.3.0 → 1.0.0`: Production platform with breaking configuration changes
- `1.5.0 → 2.0.0`: Migration from medallion to data mesh architecture

#### MINOR Version (x.y.0) - New Features
**Trigger Events:**
- New data layers or processing capabilities
- Additional analytics tables or dimensions
- New data sources or integration capabilities
- Performance improvements >20%
- New monitoring or operational features

**Examples:**
- `0.2.0 → 0.3.0`: Complete gold layer with star schema
- `0.3.0 → 0.4.0`: Real-time streaming analytics layer

#### PATCH Version (x.y.z) - Bug Fixes & Improvements
**Trigger Events:**
- Bug fixes without schema changes
- Performance improvements <20%
- Documentation updates and clarifications
- Configuration optimizations
- Security patches

**Examples:**
- `0.3.0 → 0.3.1`: Fix customer metrics aggregation bug
- `0.3.1 → 0.3.2`: Update documentation and optimize memory usage

## 🏗️ Release Types & Naming

### Release Naming Convention
Each release gets a descriptive name reflecting its primary achievement:

```

Examples:
v0.3.0 - "Gold Layer Stabilization" (2025-06-25)
v0.4.0 - "Advanced Customer Analytics" (2025-07-25)  
v1.0.0 - "Production Platform" (2026-01-01)
```

### Release Categories

- **Frequency**: Every 3-4 months
- **Scope**: Significant new capabilities or architecture changes
- **Planning**: 6-8 weeks development + 2 weeks testing
- **Documentation**: Complete migration guides + ADR records

#### 📈 **Minor Releases** (Monthly)
- **Frequency**: Every 4-6 weeks  
- **Scope**: New features, data sources, or analytics capabilities
- **Planning**: 3-4 weeks development + 1 week testing
- **Documentation**: Feature guides + changelog updates

#### 🔧 **Patch Releases** (As Needed)
- **Frequency**: 1-2 weeks for critical fixes
