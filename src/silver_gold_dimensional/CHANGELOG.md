## Architecture Decision Log

### ADR-003: Strict Data Lineage Enforcement (2025-06-25)
**Decision**: Implement fail-fast lineage validation with no bronze fallbacks in gold layer
**Impact**: 100% medallion compliance, improved data quality, reduced debugging complexity
**Trade-offs**: Less resilient to upstream failures, requires robust monitoring

### ADR-002: Individual Customer Metrics (2025-06-25)  
**Decision**: Change from aggregated to individual customer metric records
**Impact**: Enables customer segmentation, improves BI capabilities, increases data granularity
**Trade-offs**: 599x data volume increase, requires schema migration

### ADR-001: Spark 4.0.0 Type Safety (2025-06-25)
**Decision**: Mandatory explicit type casting for all JDBC operations
**Impact**: Eliminated 90% of runtime errors, improved reliability, better debugging
**Trade-offs**: More verbose code, requires developer education

## Critical Success Patterns 🎯

### **Dimensional Modeling Excellence**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Proper star schema with explicit relationships
fact_table.join(dim_customer.alias("c"), "customer_key", "left")
    .join(dim_date.alias("d"), "date_key", "left")
    .select("revenue_amount", "c.customer_tier", "d.calendar_year")
```

### **Type Safety for Spark 4.0.0**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Explicit type casting for JDBC compatibility
.withColumn("customer_key", expr("uuid()").cast(StringType()))
.withColumn("is_active", lit(True).cast(BooleanType()))
.withColumn("created_time", current_timestamp())
```

### **Fail-Fast Error Handling**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Immediate pipeline failure on errors
try:
    result = transform_gold_table(spark, config)
except Exception as e:
    raise Exception(f"CRITICAL FAILURE: {table_name} failed. {str(e)}")
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid 🚫

### **❌ NEVER: Cross-Layer Violations**
```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN: Gold reading from bronze
try:
    silver_data = read_silver()
except:
    bronze_data = read_bronze()  # LINEAGE VIOLATION!
```

### **❌ NEVER: Silent Error Handling**
```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN: Silent failure continuation
try:
    transform_data()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(e)  # Silent failure - BAD!
    continue
```

### **❌ NEVER: Column Ambiguity**
```python
# ❌ FORBIDDEN: Ambiguous column references
df1.join(df2, "common_column")  # Which customer_id?
    .select("customer_id")       # AMBIGUOUS!
```
